# Sandboxed Glowscript

A sandboxed version of a single-page glowscript editor is deployed on GitHub pages, where it can be embedded into pages where users shouldn't have open internet access. 

# Architecture

```
 index.html
    -> iframe srcdoc sandbox
        -> meta CSP
        -> iframe srcdoc=GlowScript.txt sandbox
                -> eval(user code)
```

The sandboxing works by using two iframes created with srcdoc. The upper iframe has a CSP to only allow content from 'self' and the lower iframe inherits the CSP and runs glowscript, including user code. The lower iframe cannot access the upper iframe to disable the CSP because both have the sandbox attribute without 'allow-same-origin'. Additionally, the lower iframe cannot create any iframes of its own with separate origins because of the policy frame-src 'none'. An exception is that about:blank is an allowed src, but the lower iframe isn't able to access the contentDocument of the blank iframe because they have different origins from the sandbox attribute.

The CSP used is 
```
default-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval';
frame-src 'none';
child-src 'none';
```

Because the default-src is 'self', anything on the origin, `<user|organization>.github.io` can be accessed by the sandboxed user code, hence requiring a dedicated user or organization with no other github pages deployments.

# Local Development

The sandbox can be built locally by running:
> $ npm run build:sandbox

This pulls necessary files from `/sandbox` and `/GlowScriptOffline` folders and copies to `/dist-sandbox` folder. 
Local hosting can be achieved with live server, and the sandbox can be tested by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:5500/dist-sandbox/`.

# GitHub Pages Deployment

The repository must be configured in Settings > Pages > Source to GitHub Actions.
The static.yaml file in .github/workflows is run when master is pushed to, and deploys code from the dist-sandbox folder  to `<user|organization>.github.io`
